# Hey there! Welcome to the TechWorld GitHub repo. This is where I’m developing our eCommerce platform for electronics.

# The site is built with:

-> HTML & CSS for the layout and styling.
-> Bootstrap to keep things responsive and looking sharp.
-> Python & Django for the backend, handling everything from user management to product listings.

# Feel free to check out the code, offer feedback. I’m excited to share this project and see what you think!
